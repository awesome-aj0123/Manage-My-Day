# Pyde - plan your day, everyday!

Pyde is a new way to create schedules that can automatically generate your optimal schedule and sync to your Google Calendar. Pyde takes into account fixed or flexible events, an event’s priority level, an event’s expected duration, and more to maximize your productivity.
